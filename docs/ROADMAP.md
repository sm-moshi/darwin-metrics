â€¢ Improve overall module structure and dependency organization
â€¢ Ensure async improvements apply only where necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead
â€¢ Enhance process I/O tracking and resource usage monitoring
â€¢ GPU Metrics
â€¢ Refactor Metal API usage for better VRAM tracking
â€¢ Improve multi-GPU support and error handling
â€¢ Network Monitoring
â€¢ Implement bandwidth tracking and real-time network metrics
â€¢ Implement real-time connection state monitoring
â€¢ Add interface categorization and address tracking
â€¢ Temperature Monitoring
â€¢ Add fan speed and thermal zone monitoring
â€¢ Detect and report thermal throttling events
â€¢ General Code Cleanup
â€¢ Apply Rust idiomatic principles from .windsurfrules
â€¢ Enforce modular structure and remove redundant logic
â€¢ Improve error handling and ensure meaningful error propagation
â€¢ Ensure existing tests pass after refactoring
