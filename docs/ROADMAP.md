# Roadmap for macOS System Metrics Crate

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**

- Set up Rust library structure
- Integrate `swift-bridge` for Swift interoperability
- Implement build automation (`build.rs`)
- Create a minimal working example (battery status, CPU usage)

## **Phase 2: Core System Metrics (Week 3-5)**

- Implement CPU metrics (usage, frequency, model)
- Implement memory metrics (total, used, swap)
- Implement disk metrics (storage, I/O stats)
- Write unit tests for Rust-Swift communication

## **Phase 3: Advanced Hardware Monitoring (Week 6-8)**

- Add GPU monitoring (usage, VRAM, active GPU)
- Add fan speed & temperature monitoring
- Optimize Swift API calls for performance
- Improve error handling and data caching

## **Phase 4: Process Monitoring & System Info (Week 9-11)**

- Implement process monitoring (list, CPU/memory usage)
- Fetch kernel version, uptime, and macOS version
- Implement structured logging for system metrics
- Write integration tests and benchmarking

## **Phase 5: Optimization & Release (Week 12-14)**

- Optimize system calls to reduce CPU overhead
- Improve Swift-Rust API stability
- Document Rust crate API and Swift bindings
- Publish the crate to `crates.io` and create a GitHub release
