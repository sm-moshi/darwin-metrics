  - Total system load
  - Temperature monitoring
- Basic memory statistics (In Progress)
  - RAM usage tracking
  - Swap usage monitoring
  - Memory pressure detection
- Battery information ✅
  - Charge level
  - Power source detection
  - Basic health information
- Process monitoring ✅
  - Process info collection
  - Async monitoring support
  - Resource usage tracking
- Network interface monitoring ✅
  - Basic interface enumeration
  - Network stats collection

#### Safety & Reliability

- Thread-safe resource management ✅
- Comprehensive error handling ✅
- Safe IOKit bindings ✅
- Proper cleanup of system resources ✅

#### Developer Experience

- Ergonomic Rust API ✅
- Comprehensive documentation ✅
- Usage examples ✅
- Clear error messages ✅

### Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- Rust 1.80 or later

### Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
darwin-metrics = "0.1.0"
```

### Example Usage

```rust
use darwin_metrics::prelude::*;

async fn get_system_stats() -> Result<()> {
    // Create a resource manager
    let manager = ResourceManager::new();

    // Get CPU usage
    let cpu = CPU::new()?;
    println!("CPU Usage: {}%", cpu.average_usage());

    // Get battery info
    let battery = Battery::new()?;
    println!("Battery Level: {}%", battery.percentage);

    // Monitor process metrics
    let mut metrics = Process::monitor_metrics(1, Duration::from_secs(1));
    while let Some(info) = metrics.next().await {
        println!("Process info: {:?}", info);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Known Limitations

- Memory metrics implementation is incomplete
- Advanced features (GPU, disk) planned for future releases
- Some advanced CPU features may not be available on all Mac models

### Future Plans

- Complete memory metrics implementation
- GPU monitoring
- Disk metrics
- Advanced network statistics
- Advanced process monitoring
