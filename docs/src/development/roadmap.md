**Key Tasks:**

- Optimize CPU and memory metrics for lower overhead
- Implement fan control features for supported devices
- Improve power management insights
- Reduce memory footprint and improve CPU efficiency
- Implement event-driven monitoring
- Enhance testing with performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Final Optimizations & Production Release (1.0.0) - Planned

**Goal:** Prepare for stable, production-ready release.

**Key Tasks:**

- Complete API documentation and examples
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Conduct final performance tests and optimizations
- Review API consistency
- Prepare for crates.io release

## Feature Priorities

These are our current feature priorities, ranked from highest to lowest:

1. **System Stability & Performance**: Ensuring the library has minimal impact on the host system
2. **Core Metrics Support**: Comprehensive coverage of CPU, memory, and process metrics
3. **GPU Metrics**: Support for detailed GPU usage and monitoring
4. **Network Metrics**: Monitoring of network interfaces and traffic
5. **Advanced Features**: Power management, fan control, and detailed temperature monitoring

## Release Schedule

Our current timeline is:

- **0.1.x**: Q1-Q2 2024 (Alpha releases with core functionality)
  - âœ… 0.1.0: Initial release with basic monitoring
  - âœ… 0.1.1: Improved GPU and memory monitoring
  - âœ… 0.1.2: Enhanced process tracking and disc metrics
  - âœ… 0.1.3: Improved documentation and CI workflow
- **0.2.0**: Q3 2024 (Beta release with enhanced features)
- **0.3.0**: Q4 2024 (Release candidate with optimizations)
- **1.0.0**: Q1 2025 (Stable release with complete documentation)
