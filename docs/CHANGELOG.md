- API Implementation Issues:
  - Complete real implementation of host_statistics64 for CPU core usage monitoring and VM memory statistics
  - Implement proper frequency detection through sysctlbyname("hw.cpufrequency") calls
  - Verify AppleACPICPU service compatibility with Objective-C method calls (`numberOfCores`, `numberOfProcessorCores`, etc.)
  - Update memory module to use real memory statistics instead of hardcoded values

- System Integration Issues:
  - Add support for individual core temperature sensors through additional SMC keys
  - Fix system module API calls to properly detect M1/M2/M3 chip variants
  - Add support for additional SMC temperature sensors (battery, SSD, etc.)
  - Extend fan speed monitoring with RPM conversion for different fan types
  
- GPU Advanced Metrics (Future):

    - Use `fd` instead of `find`
    - Use `bat` instead of `cat`
    - Use `eza --tree` instead of `tree`
    - Note: Some tools are installed in `/Users/smeya/.cargo/bin/` and others in `/opt/homebrew/bin/`
